<h2>🚀 About CyberMaze</h2>

<p>
CyberMaze is an innovative cybersecurity training platform designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. It offers an immersive, challenge-based learning experience across four key domains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Practice tools like Nmap and Wireshark in virtual labs.</li>
  <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Solve encryption, decryption, and hash-cracking challenges.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Gain hands-on experience with AWS services like EC2, S3, CloudFormation, and IAM.</li>
  <li><strong>Capture The Flag (CTF):</strong> Engage in interactive cybersecurity scenarios simulating real-world attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The platform is built using <strong>Django (Backend)</strong> and <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)</strong>. It deploys secure virtual environments (including Kali Linux on AWS) to ensure realistic and risk-free practice.
